# tutor_tracking
A Tutor App that tracks tutor's modules, students and their info

An App that uses Ktor framework features like authentication & routing in order to register/login tutors as well as saving students info locally
(Android device) and remotely through the server into MongoDb.
The app syncs all the offline CREATE, DELETE, & UPDATE operations when the user connects to the internet and refreshes.
And with extra minor features.
